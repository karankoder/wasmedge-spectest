# Introduction

**WasmEdge-spectest** is a repository of spec test data by extracting WebAssembly (WASM) test suites.

* Test data is from [WebAssembly Core Tests](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/master/test/core) and tests from every proposals.

* [S-Expression script](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/blob/main/interpreter/README.md#scripts) of tests are extracted into `json` and `wasm` files by [wast2json](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wast2json.1.html) tool in [wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt).

* For those WASM text format not supported by [wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) currently, parsing and converting into binary files are credited by [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools).

* For the [Component Model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) tests, the `json-from-wast` command of [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) is used for extracting into `json` and `wasm` files.

## Folders

* `wasm-1.0`: The WASM 1.0 tests with the following proposal:
  * [Import/Export of Mutable Globals](https://github.com/WebAssembly/mutable-global)
* `wasm-2.0`: The WASM 2.0 tests with WASM 1.0 and the following proposals:
  * [Non-trapping float-to-int conversions](https://github.com/WebAssembly/nontrapping-float-to-int-conversions)
  * [Sign-extension operators](https://github.com/WebAssembly/sign-extension-ops)
  * [Multi-value](https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value)
  * [Reference Types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types)
  * [Bulk memory operations](https://github.com/WebAssembly/bulk-memory-operations)
  * [Fixed-width SIMD](https://github.com/webassembly/simd)
* `wasm-3.0` prefixed folders: The WASM 3.0 tests with WASM 1.0, WASM 2.0, and the following proposals:
  * [Exception handling](https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling)
  * [Extended Constant Expressions](https://github.com/WebAssembly/extended-const)
  * [Typed Function References](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references)
  * [Garbage collection](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc)
  * [Memory64](https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64) (Temorary not added due to unimplementation in WasmEdge)
  * [Multiple memories](https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-memory)
  * [Relaxed SIMD](https://github.com/WebAssembly/relaxed-simd)
  * [Tail call](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tail-call)
* `threads`: The tests of the [Threads](https://github.com/webassembly/threads) proposal.
* `exception-handling-legacy`: The legacy version tests of the [Exception handling](https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling) proposal.
  * This is deprecated.
* `component-model`: The tests of the [Component Model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) proposal.

## Whats Difference

* `wasm-2.0/select/select.wast` line 325: `invalid result arity` -> `type mismatch`
  * This error message is for the WAT format, WASM format cannot detect this error by the bytecode.
* `wasm-3.0/select/select.wast` line 369: `invalid result arity` -> `type mismatch`
  * This error message is for the WAT format, WASM format cannot detect this error by the bytecode.
* `wasm-3.0/instance` folder moved to `wasm-3.0-exceptions`
  * Temporary move this test set to the exception handling folder until the implementation of exception-handling proposal of AOT/JIT finished in WasmEdge.
* Updated the error message text for old tests
  * Update the `global is immutable` to `immutable global` according to the newest test suite.
    * `wasm-1.0/global/global.wast` line 244
    * `wasm-2.0/global/global.wast` line 274, 279
* New S-Expression script not supported by [wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)
  * module definition: add a new `"module_definition"` type in commands array in JSON which has the same content structure as `"module"`.
    * `wasm-3.0/instance/instance.wast` line 3, 109
    * `wasm-3.0/memory/memory.wast` line 8
    * `wasm-3.0/table/table.wast` line 9
    * `wasm-3.0-memory64/memory64/memory64.wast` line 8
    * `wasm-3.0-memory64/table64/table64.wast` line 9
  * module instance: add a new `"module_instance"` type in commands array in JSON which has almost the same content structure as `"register"`, but use the `"definition"` to present the name of module definition source.
    * `wasm-3.0/instance/instance.wast` line 10, 11, 125
* `threads/atomic/atomic.wast`: divergence behavior
  * Please check [this issue](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/issues/195).
  * Modified the `wast` file for fitting the `compare_exchange_strong` behavior in C++.
* `threads/atomic_wait_notify/atomic_wait_notify.wast`: line 73: remove the thread tests.
  * The S-Expression of threads cannot be parsed by wabt, therefore remove them.
